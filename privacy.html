        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Walk Habit</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "App") values your privacy and complies with
            applicable laws and regulations. This Privacy Policy explains how the App collects, uses, and stores your
            personal information.</p>

        <h2>1. Privacy Principles</h2>
        <p>The App can be used <strong>without a separate sign-up process</strong>, and it uses minimal device
            permissions solely for providing services. As a rule, the developer does not transmit or collect personal
            identifiable information (name, email, phone number, etc.) to any external server.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect and Purpose of Use</h2>
        <p>The permissions requested by the App and their purposes are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Camera & Photo Library Permissions</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Taking workout verification photos, <strong>checking for faces
                            (privacy warning)</strong>, storing body check records, and applying templates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Captured or selected images are stored locally on your device. Only
                        if the user explicitly taps the 'Save' button, images may be copied to the system photo gallery
                        (album). <strong>Face detection is performed entirely on-device, and no face data is collected
                            or transmitted.</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2. Payment Information (In-App Purchase)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Purchasing and restoring Premium Membership.</li>
                    <li><strong>Processing:</strong> All payments are processed through the Apple App Store or Google
                        Play Store. The App does not directly collect or hold your credit card number or account
                        information.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>3. App Tracking Transparency (iOS)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Providing personalized advertisements via the Advertising Identifier
                        (IDFA) and measuring ad effectiveness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Processing:</strong> For iOS users, the App requests tracking permission upon the first
                        launch. The identifier is used only if permission is granted. If denied, the App remains
                        functional, but non-personalized (generic) ads may be displayed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Retention and Destruction of Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. All data in the App (workout records, photos, settings, etc.) is <strong>stored only on your
                    device</strong>.</li>
            <li>2. If a user uses Biometric authentication (Face ID/Fingerprint) to lock the 'Body Check Gallery', the
                App only receives a success/fail signal from the OS and never accesses or stores the biometric data
                itself.</li>
            <li>3. If a user uses the "Clear Data" feature or deletes the App, the data stored on the device is
                immediately deleted and cannot be recovered.</li>
            <li>4. The developer does not store user data on servers and is not responsible for recovering lost data.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services (SDKs) to display advertisements and analyze app stability. During
            this process, the following information may be collected and transmitted in accordance with each service
            provider's policies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collected Data:</strong> Device Identifiers (Device ID, Advertising ID), Product Interaction,
                Advertising Data, Crash & Performance Data.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose of Use:</strong> Third-Party Advertising, Analytics, App Functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The collected data is processed according to the privacy policy of each service provider.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob (Advertising):</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google
                    Privacy Policy</a></li>

                    href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Privacy Rights (GDPR & CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GDPR (EU Users):</strong> You have the right to access, rectify, erase, and restrict the
                processing of your data. Since this App stores data locally, uninstalling the App will immediately erase
                all data. You may opt-out of ad tracking via your device settings ('Limit Ad Tracking' or 'App Tracking
                Transparency').</li>
            <li><strong>CCPA/CPRA (California Users):</strong> California residents have the right to opt-out of the
                sale or sharing of their personal information ("Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information"). We do
                not sell your personal information. However, tailored ads may be served by our advertising partners. You
                may limit this via your device settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Disclosure and Sharing</h2>
        <p>Except for the third-party services (SDKs) listed above, the App does not provide or entrust personal
            information to third parties without your consent. However, if you use the 'Share' feature to send images to
            SNS or external messengers, information may be processed according to the terms of those services.</p>
