        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <h2>Article 1 (Purpose)</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Service aim to regulate the conditions and procedures of use, as well as the rights,
            obligations, and responsibilities of the user and the developer concerning the services provided by "Walk
            Habit" (hereinafter referred to as "App").</p>

        <h2>Article 2 (Provision and Change of Services)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. The App provides recording, statistics, notifications, and premium features to help users form
                walking habits.</li>
            <li>2. The developer may change the content of the services provided to improve service quality or reflect
                changes in technical specifications.</li>
            <li>3. The App is fundamentally a "Local-Based" service where data is processed <strong>within the user's
                    device</strong>. However, in-app purchase information is managed through the respective app stores
                (Apple App
                Store or Google Play Store).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Article 3 (Paid Services and Payments)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Users can access premium features via In-App Purchase.</li>
            <li>2. Premium features are provided on a "Lifetime Access" basis with a one-time payment, and the price is
                subject to the policies of the respective app stores.</li>
            <li>3. <strong>Refund Policy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refunds for in-app purchases must be processed according to the refund policies and procedures
                        of the app store (Apple/Google) used by the user.</li>
                    <li>The developer does not hold direct payment information and may not be able to process refunds
                        directly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>4. If a user changes devices but uses the same store account, they can maintain their existing purchase
                history through the "Restore Purchase" feature.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Article 4 (User Obligations and Data Management)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Users shall not use the App for illegal purposes or for infringing upon the rights of others.</li>
            <li>2. Users are responsible for managing their own device and the data within the App.</li>
            <li>3. <strong>Data Loss Warning:</strong> Data loss caused by device change, App deletion, or user action
                (data reset)
                cannot be recovered. Users should manage important records separately.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Article 5 (Copyright Ownership)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Copyright for all content provided by the App, including services, designs, characters (e.g., Dino),
                text, and graphics, belongs to the developer ("Walk Habit Team").</li>
            <li>2. Users shall not copy, distribute, or use information obtained through the service for commercial
                purposes without prior consent from the developer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Article 6 (Disclaimer)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. This App is an auxiliary tool to help form healthy habits and does not substitute for professional
                medical diagnosis or advice. The developer is not responsible for any physical injury resulting from
                excessive exercise.</li>
            <li>2. The developer is exempted from responsibility if the service cannot be provided temporarily due to
                force majeure, such as natural disasters, server maintenance (related to payments), or communication
                failures.</li>
            <li>3. The developer is not responsible for damages caused by user negligence (e.g., loss of device,
                exposure of password).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Article 7 (Termination of Service)</h2>
        <p>The developer may terminate the service for business or technical reasons, in which case users will be
            notified via notices within the App.</p>

        <h2>Article 8 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction)</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the <strong>State of Texas,
                United States</strong>. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought
            exclusively in the courts located in <strong>Texas, United States</strong>.</p>
